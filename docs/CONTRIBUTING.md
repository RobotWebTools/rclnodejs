# Contributing to rclnodejs
Thank you for considering contributing to rclnodejs. All help appreciated.

## Bugs and Feature Requests
If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, [make one](https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rclnodejs/issues/new)! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

## Getting Started
### Communications and Coordination
If there is a bug or feature request you would like to work on begin by communicating your interest in resolving it. A project maintainer will assign the issue to you.

### Process
Here's the process to follow once a bug or feature request has been assigned to you:

#### Setting up your rclnodejs codebase
1. Fork the rclnodejs project. Refer to the [Building from Scratch Guide](BUILDING.md).
2. Build your the base project and ensure the test suite runs.
3. Make a branch for your new code.

#### Coding your Fix or Feature
1. Code your fix or new feature on your new branch. 
2. Code new tests or modify existing tests to cover your changes.
3. Check for coding style compliance: `npm run lint`. Fix any coding style issues.
4. Run the test suite and ensure all tests pass.
5. Commit your changes to your cloned repo.

#### Submitting your Code
1. Submit your changes for review by opening a Pull Request (PR) on the rclnodejs project. Fix any CI failures resulting from your code changes.
2. The PR will be reviewed by the project team members. Please keep the PR updated to reflect reviewer comments and requests. You may also be requested to rebase the PR and fix any conflicts. When the PR has gained "Looks Good To Me (LGTM)" status, the project maintainers will merge the PR.
