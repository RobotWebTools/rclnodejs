* Verify that you are using a compatible version of node between 6.10 - 10.99: run  `node -v` for your node version info. 

* Install from npmjs: run `npm i rclnodejs@<version>` to install a specific version.

* Install from GitHub: add `"rclnodejs":"RobotWebTools/rclnodejs#<branch>"` to your `package.json`.

## Build from Scratch

### Get ready for ROS 2

1.Install ROS 2.0 from binary package.

ROS 2.0 is a cross-platform system, which covers Linux, macOS and Windows, and the `rclnodejs` module is developed against the [`master`](https://github.com/ros2/ros2/blob/master/ros2.repos) branch of ROS 2.0. You can download the latest binary packages from [ROS 2.0 build farm](http://ci.ros2.org/view/packaging/) and follow the instructions of [Linux](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Linux-Install-Binary/)/[macOS](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/OSX-Install-Binary/)/[Windows](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Windows-Install-Binary/) to setup the environment (If you want to run your apps on a stable release of ROS 2.0, e.g. crystal-clemmys, please see the section `Running on Stable Release of ROS 2.0`).

2.Build ROS 2.0 from scratch.

Alternatively, you can build ROS 2.0 from scratch. Please select the platform you want to work on, then reference the instructions of [Linux](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Linux-Development-Setup/)/[macOS](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/OSX-Development-Setup/)/[Windows](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Windows-Development-Setup/) to build ROS 2.0 (please build wiht flag `--merge-install`).

### Install `Node.js`

**Notice:**
`rclnodejs` should only be used with node versions between 6.10 - 10.99. The lowest LTS Node.js we used to verify the unit tests is `6.10.0`. And there is a known issue installing rclnodejs with versions of node >= 11.0.

The `Node.js` version we selected is the LTS [`Carbon`](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-carbon/) (8.x). You can install it:

* Download from Node.js offical [website](https://nodejs.org/en/), and install it.
* Use the Node Version Manager ([nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)) to install it.

### Get Code

Open a terminal, and input:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rclnodejs.git
```

then enter the folder `rclnodejs`, and get the submodule:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Build Module

Before you build the module, you should make sure the ROS2 environments were loaded. You can check if the `AMENT_PREFIX_PATH` environment variable was set:

* For Windows: `echo %AMENT_PREFIX_PATH%` in the command prompt.

* For Linux and macOS: `echo $AMENT_PREFIX_PATH` in the terminal.

If the `AMENT_PREFIX_PATH` is unset, you should load the ROS2 environments:

* For Windows, open the command prompt and run

```bash
  call <path\to\ros2>\install\local_setup.bat
```

* For Linux and macOS, open the terminal and run:

```bash
  source <path/to/ros2>/install/local_setup.bash
```

This `Node.js` module is built by [node-gyp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp), all you have to do is just to run the following command:

```javascript
npm install
```

**Windows-specific**: make sure Python 2.x interpreter is first searched in your `PATH` before running the command. You can change it temporarily by:

```bash
  set PATH=<path\to\python 2.x>;%PATH%
```

## Run Unit Test

[mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) is a javascript test framework for node.js, simply run the following command to run the unit test under `test` folder:

```javascript
npm run test
```

**Windows-specific**: the tests requires in a `Microsoft Visual Studio Native Tools command prompt`,  and also make sure Python 3.x interpreter is first searched in your `PATH` before running te test. You can change it temporarily by:

```bash
  set PATH=<path\to\python 3.x>;%PATH%
```

## How To Use

After building this module, you just need to follow the normal way to use it as a `Node.js` module.

```javascript
const rclnodejs = require('../index.js');

rclnodejs.init().then(() => {
  let String = rclnodejs.require('std_msgs').msg.String;
  const node = rclnodejs.createNode('publisher_example_node');
  const publisher = node.createPublisher(String, 'topic');
  let msg = new String();

  setInterval(function() {
    const str = 'Hello ROS2.0';
    msg.data = str;
    publisher.publish(msg);
  }, 1000);

  rclnodejs.spin(node);
});
```

There are also several useful examples under the `example` folder, which will show you how to use some important features, including `timer/subscription/publisher/client/service/time/node graph`. You are encouraged to try these examples to understand them.

## API Specification

The API spec is generated by `jsdoc`, you can manually run `npm run docs` to create them by yourself, or just use the existing documents under `docs` folder.

To visit the on-line version, please navigate to http://robotwebtools.org/rclnodejs/docs/index.html in your browser.

## Experimental - Deprecated

* [actionlib](https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rclnodejs/blob/develop/tutorials/actionlib.md) - as the [rcl](https://github.com/ros2/rcl) library has implemented the action related functions, we are going to drop this one and we don't garantee the current actionlib can work with [rclcpp](https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp).

## Troubleshooting

### Maximum call stack size exceeded error when running in Jest
When running tests in Jest, you may see an error like this:
```
RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded

      at debug (../node_modules/ref/node_modules/debug/src/debug.js:1:1)
      at Object.writePointer [as _writePointer] (../node_modules/ref/lib/ref.js:746:3)

      at Object.writePointer [as _writePointer] (../node_modules/ref/lib/ref.js:747:11)
```
This is caused by a bug in `ref` which happens when you `require` it multiple times. There is a fix available for `ref` but it's no longer being maintained and the author has not published it.


If it is required to use Jest, a solution would be to fork `ref` and use npm shrinkwrap to installed a patched version.
